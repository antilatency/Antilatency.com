                    This property enables the transmitter to connect only to a specific receiver. After receiving the serial number from the receiver, you can enter it into the `MasterSN` setting of the transmitter. It will then connect only to the receiver with this serial number.
                    You can set this up in two ways (by using a button on the socket {ConfiguringRadioDevices:SetMasterSoft} and with the help of {Terms.AntilatencyService}. For more information, please see {ConfiguringRadioDevices:SetMasterHard}). The receiver will display this setting as enabled or not, see {Hardware.Tag:LED signals}. "]

                [$@"`ChannelsMask` 
                    sets the channel mask for the transmitter to look for a receiver connection.  
                    This is a 141-symbol line (corresponds to the number of available channels) consisting of 0's and 1's where 1 denotes that the respective channel will be used while searching for a receiver while 0 implies that the channels will be ignored. The first symbol in the line is responsible for the last channel (140). 
                The default channel mask looks as follows: 
                `000000000000000000001000001000000000000000000000100000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000001000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
                The location of 1's in this mask corresponds to the default channel list (42, 66, 92, 114, 120).
                For your convenience, you can use aliases that can be sent instead of a line mask: {new UnorderedList()
                        [$"`full` - all channels are active for search"]
                        [$"`default` - only five channels are active for search by default"]
                        [$"`N` - only channel 'N' is active for search. For example, for channel `140` a `100....000` mask will be set"]}"]

                [@$"`RadioChannel`
                    The default setting is `-1`. The receiver will randomly select the first available radio channel from the list: 42 = 2402 MHz, 66 = 2426 MHz, 92 = 2452 MHz, 114 = 2474 MHz, 120 = 2480 MHz.
                    You can set a specific channel in the range of `0 - 140`, that will be used. To know how the channel id is mapped to a radio frequency, please see {Terms.Antilatency_Radio_Protocol:channels}
                "]
                [@$"`ConnLimit`
                    This is a maximum number of transmitters that that can connect to this receiver. The `0` value shuts down the radio on the device completely. If the value exceeds the number of connected devices, part of the traffic will go toward searching for new devices. Therefore, set this value to exactly match the number of the planned connections."]
